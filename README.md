# tetris-discord

Tetris! but on discord! it's also almost guideline compliant.. kinda

This is still a huge WIP, I'll add more info on it with time, for now you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ytJj3eQ74B) and check it out yourself! That is if I'm awake, probably

## What won't be done (probably)

* **Full board size**, there's not enough space for 20 lines if using custom emotes, so instead there are 16 (although pieces do spawn at rows 21-22)
* ??????
* i forgor ðŸ’€


## What has been done (mostly)

* Many many modes! including uhm, zen mode! and zen mode! and.. zen! (mode?)
* Map converter thing ???
  * i don't know it's useful to store boards in less space
* A reallly complex database! it consists of over *2* data tables and is saved in **JSON!!!!** very fast (i haven't tested speed yet)
* A lot of stuff basically
* DT Cannons are 100% supported! (7-bag system, SRS (with TETR.IO 180 kicks!), TSTs and TSDs! (you can even perfect clear afterwards!!))
